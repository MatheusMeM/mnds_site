      "body": "## Simbiose — The Connection Through Fungi\n\nOi Futuro, Rio de Janeiro — early 2023\n\nAn immersive, free, all‑ages exhibition that invited visitors to wander through the hidden intelligence of fungi. The space combined projection‑mapped visuals, responsive light, and an enveloping soundscape to illustrate how fungal networks communicate, recycle, and sustain life. Instead of a didactic tech demo, the room behaved like an ecosystem: media, light, and sound breathed together, rising and falling in a shared rhythm—alive, interconnected, and quietly powerful.\n\n## My role\n\nI led show‑control software and technical direction for systems integration. In practice, that meant designing the control architecture, programming the real‑time engine in TouchDesigner, and ensuring projection, lighting, and audio stayed precisely in sync from the first boot of the day to the last visitor at night.\n\n## How it worked\n\nThe exhibition ran on a single, cohesive control brain: **TouchDesigner**. From there, we mapped the projection surface, drove the audio, and orchestrated the lighting so every cue felt organic and synchronized. Networking mattered: sACN carried both the high‑density pixel data to an Advatek controller for WS2812 arrays and the DMX universes that fed the LED PARs and pixel battens. A unified clock and cue logic kept everything aligned—video pulses, color shifts, and sonic textures locked together, so visitors perceived one coherent organism rather than separate systems.\n\nOperationally, the show started itself. Each morning, the system booted unattended, launched the right components in the right order, verified device presence, and settled into the opening scene. Staff didn’t need to “drive” the rig.\n\n## Responsibilities\n\n- Show‑control architecture and integration across video, lighting, and audio\n- TouchDesigner programming for media playback, real‑time sync, cueing, and automation\n- Projection mapping and edge‑blending (Kantan Mapper inside TouchDesigner)\n- Lighting control:\n    - sACN to Advatek node for WS2812 pixel arrays and DMX512 output.\n- Reliability and operations: unattended startup, health checks, recovery steps, and staff training\n\n## Technical notes \n\n- TouchDesigner as the single show‑control engine: media, lighting, audio, timing, and state management in one place\n- Projection mapping and warping handled via Kantan Mapper; GPU‑direct outputs to the projectors\n- Lighting data split at the network layer:\n    - High‑bandwidth pixel streams over sACN to an Advatek controller (WS2812)\n    - Fixture control (LED PARs, pixel battens) as sACN universes bridged to DMX512\n- Unified cue stack and clocking ensured per‑frame alignment of media, color, and sound\n- Automated daily startup; friendly shutdown/startup procedures for the on‑site team\n\n## Links\n\n- Oi Futuro (exhibition): [![Ícone do site](https://app.adapta.one/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fs2%2Ffavicons%3Fdomain%3Doifuturo.org.br%26sz%3D16&w=32&q=75)oifuturo.org.br](https://oifuturo.org.br/evento/seminario-simbiose-a-conexao-pelos-fungos/)",

      "body": "# Brasileirão Série A — Title Sequence for SporTV\n\n## About\n\nInvited by I Hate Flash to lead technical direction, I built the look in-camera. We installed an L‑shaped LED wall to force perspective and lit talent with practical sources, so light, color, and reflections came from real photons—not post. The result is sharp, athletic, and tactile, with depth and texture captured live on set.\n\n## My role\n\nI led technical direction and delivered the hardware stack, operating motion playback, creating part of the content, and integrating assets from other artists. I matched the camera to the LED system—tests for distance, focal length, aperture, and shutter vs. panel refresh—to avoid moiré and keep images clean.\n\n## How it worked\n\nWe aligned and mapped the corner LED to sell perspective through geometry and content. Practical lighting projector was time‑linked to the motion. Camera–LED calibration buried pixel pitch in focus and eliminated moiré, letting the wall read as a seamless environment rather than a screen.\n\n## Responsibilities\n\n- Technical direction and hardware delivery\n- LED corner wall: supply, assembly, mapping, and calibration\n- Motion operation and content integration (ours + guest artists)\n\n## Technical notes\n\n- L‑shaped LED geometry for in‑camera forced perspective\n- Content mapped at native panel resolution to prevent resampling artifacts\n- Moiré control via distance/focal/aperture and shutter/refresh alignment\n\n## Technologies\n\n- LED wall + processor (corner configuration)\n- Resolume Arena media server for playback, sync, and mapping",
